This repository contains all the necessary files to run the Projekt Asclepius health monitoring system and test its components.

Projekt Asclepius is a continuous health monitoring system that logs a patient's current conditions as well as the ambient conditions of the room. Automation rules can also be created to
control the room's ventilation, lights, heat and send email notifications if a sensor exceeds a certain value. The web server provides a GUI to view the
room's current conditions and create automation rules. A local copy of the Firebase database will also be stored on the display node in an SQL database providing a backup of the
recorded data. The sensor suite for Projekt Asclepius contains a heartbeat sensor, blood oxygen sensor, body temperature sensor, room temperature sensor, room humidity sensor and ambient light sensor.

## [DisplayNode](DisplayNode/)
Sub-directory containing the files related to the display node. 

## [EnviromentalControlNode](EnviromentalControlNode/)
Sub-directory containing the files related to the environmental control node. 

## [SensorNode](SensorNode/)
Sub-directory containing the files related to the sensor node. 

## [WebServer](WebServer/)
Sub-directory containing the files related to the web server and website. 

## [TestSuite](TestSuite/)
Sub-directory containing the files related to the unit test suite. run.py executes the automated test suite that encapsulates the tests that could be automated.
There are also various other tests in this directory that cannot be automated such as testing the relays. 

## [WeeklyUpdate](WeeklyUpdates/)
Sub-directory containing the weekly WIPUR for all four group members. 

### Setup instructions

To run the Projekt Asclepius health monitoring system there are four python scripts that must be run.

The sensor nodes must be connected to the sensors and run SensorNode/unit test/comp_val_read.py which will collect the sensor data and send it to the Firebase database.
The display node hosts the web server as well as the local database. On the display node run DisplayNode/displayNode.py this script will create the local SQL database and
send emails according to the automation rules that have been set. WebServer/app.py must also be run to start the web server the website can then be accessed. the environmental
control node must be connected to the relays controlling the ventilation, heat and lights. Then run EnviromentalControlNode/ec_node.py This will then begin polling the database for the latest sensor data and compare it to the automation rules.
